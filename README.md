# Miningmark-Industry-V2

This is my first browser game that I have developed, it is a kind of idle clicker. The game is about evacuating the earth to Alpha Centauri, you have to mine resources and research different ways to reach the goal. 
You can play the game [here](https://miningmark.github.io/Miningmark-Industry-V2/). Unfortunately, the game is currently only available in German.
